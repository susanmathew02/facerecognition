This Python project implements face recognition using the OpenCV library and the dlib toolkit. It detects faces in images and identifies known faces by leveraging pre-trained models for facial recognition. The project utilizes OpenCV for image processing and facial detection, while dlib provides robust face recognition capabilities using a deep learning model. By comparing the detected faces against a dataset of known faces, the system can accurately recognize individuals. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision and machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios, such as security and user authentication systems.
